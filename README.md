# Scalable Microservices with Django, FastAPI & Kubernetes

Welcome to the documentation for the Scalable Microservices with Django, FastAPI & Kubernetes

## Project Overview: PDF Converter with Microservices

This project is part of a hands-on course where we build a PDF Converter powered by a modern microservices architecture. The goal is to teach you how to design, develop, and deploy scalable, production-ready systems using today‚Äôs most in-demand technologies.

## Tech Stack Highlights

Backend Microservices: Django & FastAPI
Databases: PostgreSQL & MongoDB
Messaging Queue: RabbitMQ for async communication
Containerization & Orchestration: Docker & Kubernetes
Architecture: Fully containerized, scalable, and cloud-ready microservices setup

## What You‚Äôll Learn

How to break down a monolith into microservices
Designing APIs using Django & FastAPI
Handling async tasks with RabbitMQ
Managing multiple databases in a microservice environment
Deploying and scaling services using Kubernetes & Docker

## Real-World Project

By the end of this project, you‚Äôll have a production-ready PDF Converter application and the skills to build similar systems in your own projects or workplace.


## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the course website.
## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get started with the project, please follow the instructions below:

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

## Project Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/okotdaniel/microservices-course-docs.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd microservices-course-docs
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

Your application should now be up and running within the virtual environment.
